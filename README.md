# [Tea Steeping Chart](http://thesocietea.org/tea-chart)

 [The Societea](http://thesocietea.org)

 This is a basic tea chart to be used as a quick reference when brewing
 your own loose leaf tea. <b>Note:</b> The data on this chart is based
 on the Western tea brewing style, which is different from the Asian
 brewing style in the following ways:

 * Less tea leaves
 * More water (and a greater vessel too, e.g. teapot)
 * Longer steep times

 The tea chart is very lightly based on the [Cyborg Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/cyborg) 
 and also utilizes basic customized color themes. Please fork and contribute
 if you would like, or just use it as a reference.
